(1) Extension.cpp solved the problem of finding out the average distance to an actor from all other actors in the movie_casts.tsv

(2)Implement:
To find the average distance to an actor, we firstly used Dijkstra Algorithm to find the shortest paths to an actor node from all other actor nodes in the actor graph. 
Then, we add up all those distances to get the total distance.
Finally, divide the total distance by the number which equals to size of actor nodes in the graph minus one to get average distance.

(3)Test
It will take 4 command-line arguments:
1. The first is a text file containing the movie casts n the same format as movie_casts.tsv. 
2. The second is a lower-case character equal to u or w - "u" means build the graph with un-weighted edges, while "w" means build the graph with weighted edges where weights are computed with the formula described above.
3. The third is a text file containing name of actors for which you want to compute the average distance to. The first line is a header, then each row contains the names of only one actor followed by a single tab character.
4. The fourth argument is an output text file containing the average distance to the actor given in the input file in argument 3.
An example of command line is “ ./extension movie_casts.tsv u test_extension testout”
As the moive_casts.tsv file is too large, we firstly use a small test file to test our algorithm. 
This small test file contains five actors called A, B, C, D, E and ten movies casted by these actors. 
And their relationships can be expressed manually by the graph1(graph1 is saved in the graph1.jpg):

By using the command “ ./extension small_movie_casts.tsv u small_ test_extension testout”, we computed the average distance to A, B ,C D, E.
The results are 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1, 1.25 which is consistent with the graph we constructed. 
Then we tested the actors in the file movie_casts.tsv given by the instructor.
We tested six actors :BACON, KEVIN (I), HOUNSOU, DJIMON, KIDMAN, NICOLE, WILLIS, BRUCE, GIAMATTI, PAUL, 50 CENT. 
And the average distance to them are 
1.9535,1.97219,1.94234,1.86882,1.89078,1.97651 using un-weighted graph. 
When using weighted graph, average distance to them are 9.72263,8.02052,9.19774,7.75078,8.24828,9.01272.
